As I said on the home page, my name is Tim Frew and I am a third year Software Engineering student at Auckland University. I grew up on the North Shore of Auckland and am lucky enough to still call it my home today.

I attended Long Bay College and finished Level 3 NCEA there in 2014, with the intention of pursuing Mechanical Engineering through my University studies. However, during the generalised first year of Engineering, I discovered Software Engineering. An area of study that seemed, at first, foreign and daunting to attempt soon became a passion of mine and I decided to select this as my specialisation.
